0.a bitmap file supports (2 to the power of 32) colors, GIF (256 colors)
 , PNG and JPEG(2 to the power of 24)colors.
 
1.  GIF supports animation.

2.lossy compression doen't encode all the information of the file so that when the file is
decompressed, it will not be the exact representation of the original.
lossless compression encodes all the information of the file 
so that the compressed file and the original file are identical .

3.JPEG format.

4.the system changes the first character in the file's directory entry to indicate that the file has 
been removed.the system moves all the file clusters to hard drive's free clusters.
the actual data in the file doesn't change. 

5.we can use sanitization tools that can remove all the data from disk before it's repurposed.

6.stdint.h is a library that enables us to use integers of different width .like uint8-t

7.using those variables allows us to store data of a fixed size in them and
 that makes it easier for us to manipulate data like images.
 
8.a BYTE = 1 byte,a DWORD and a LONG = 4 bytes, a WORD = 2 bytes.

9.in ASCII (BM),in hexa (42 4d).

10.bfSize is a member in BITMAPFILEHEADER and represents the size of the bmp file in bytes.
biSize is also a member in BITMAPINFOHEADER and represents the size of the header structure.
 
11. it means that the file is a top down DIB and its origin is at the upper-left corner.

12.biBitCount field specifies the color depth.

13. it might return NULL if the operating system is out of memory or
 if we try to open a file and we didn't have proper permissions.
 
14.because we want to process different structures like headers and RGBTRIPLE.

15.3 bytes of padding(zeros) in each scanline.

16. fseek is a function that allows us to move to a certain position in a file.

17.SEEk_CUR is the current position where the file pointer is at
